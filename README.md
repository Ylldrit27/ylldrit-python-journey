# 🐍 Ylldrit’s Python Journey

Welcome to Ylldrit’s Python Journey — a collection of Python projects created as I learn and strengthen my skills in programming.
This repository acts as both a **learning log** and a **portfolio**, demonstrating my progress from fundamental Python concepts to more advanced applications.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repo is designed to:
* 📘 Track my growth as I learn Python
* 🧠 Build a solid foundation in programming concepts
* 🛠️ Explore real-world problems through small, manageable projects
* 📂 Showcase my work to future employers, mentors, and collaborators
* 📝 Maintain clean documentation through project-specific READMEs

## 🧩 Structure of the Repository
Each project in this repository lives in its own folder and includes:
* A Python script (`.py`)
    * Contains fully working code
    * Well-commented and readable
* A project-specific `README.md`
    * Explains the goal of the project
    * Describes how the code works
    * Includes usage examples
    * Lists any future improvements

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here
This repository will grow over time and include projects covering:
* Fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, data types)
* Algorithms & problem-solving
* File handling
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Data structures
* Mini-apps and utilities
* Exploratory scripts
* Anything else I learn along the way

## 🚀 Goals
* Become confident with Python
* Develop practical programming skills
* Prepare for technical roles and personal projects
* Learn through building, experimenting, and documenting

## 📈 Progress
I will continuously update this repository with:
* New project folders
* Better code as I improve
* Ideas for future enhancements
* Stay tuned for more projects as my journey continues!

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback
This repo is primarily for my learning, but **constructive feedback, suggestions, or learning tips are always welcome**. If you have advice for improvement, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
